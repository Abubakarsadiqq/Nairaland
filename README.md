# NairaLand + GenZTechies

Let's get started ðŸš€ðŸš€

## About
Our goal is to build the new [NairaLand Design](https://www.figma.com/file/HwRRwdEXA5Nx6GhbUHM04F/Nairaland-Web-Design?node-id=19%3A3791) using plain HTML/CSS. The reason for this is to allow more people contribute. Yes, the code will later be implemented using a framework when approved

## Contributing Code
There are three folder 
- assets/
- components/
- pages/

### Components
- The project will start off by building out each component specified in the design file. 
- Each component will have it's own folder in the components directory 
- The folder should contain all the elements required to build the component and implemented in an index.html file
- All images, css or javascript should be in thier corresponding folder
- Do not create any new js or css file use the one already in place
- When the component is complete implement in "components/index.html" using the demo guide

### Assets

- CSS and JavaScript go into the main.css or main.js
